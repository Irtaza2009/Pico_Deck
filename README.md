# Pico Deck + USB Rubber Ducky 

### **A flash-drive-sized USB macropad and rubber ducky!**  

A small **flash-drive** but with *__buttonnnnsssss for shortcuts__* instead of storage!! And with a _custom **rp2040** devboard!_
And _**LEDDDsss!**_
And it can _run different scripts_ on the computer it's plugged into, like a **USB rubber ducky**!

I created this to learn how to make a devboard, how hard it is, and what modifications can be applied to it!
